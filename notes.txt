Hi my name is Hannah Lazarus
I've been learning javascript for about half a year
The thing I really love about javascript is its meant for the web, which means its meant for sharing.

Last Oct I found this beautiful codepen pen by Tiffany Rayside.
She named Deliquescent.

She's made all these inventive pens
But I saw this one first, and when I saw this one I was like
I wanna know how she did that

This is your part.

What's happening here?
--
Here's my summary
--
We're going to focus on how the point moves
--
Each point is caught in a 4 way tug of war with its neighbors.

That's how movement ripples across the grid.

If we take the difference in position of the middle point, and the position of each of its neighbors, we get a resultant vector showing who's winnign the tug of war. 

But really, all we're doing is addition and subtraction.

This shows the total x difference, y difference

--

Ok, so now we know about the "Pull component"

Shift is also a function of itself, what about that?

Here's what we started with. 

Let's factor out the Shift

and plug in a real number.

--

so if we're multiplying by 97%, what's the decay constant?

--

97% might not seem like much of a reduction, but if you do this 60 times a second (which is standard for a javascript animation) for 2 seconds?

You're not left with much. 3% of the movement you started with.

Tiffany's file shows experimentation
In mine all the variables have been renamed,
code is reorganized, equations are rearraged, some unused stuff was cut out
except for color and lines its the exact same thing
Github history shows transformation

Endnotes:

hanhanhan on github and codepen.
I'm turning this talk into a codepen post.
I have to leave at 8:10 :(

Contact me!
If anyone is starting learning and wants to ask me questions, I'm leaving cards with Liz.
If anyone is done learning and/or is willing to answer my questions, please take a card.
I'm also job curious.

--------------

Net pull - 4 neighbors - move neighbor points to recalculate pull
Result position = recursive series summation
Constants - vary values
